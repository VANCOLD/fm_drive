// @weaponblock tf_weapon_axe

// Axe is both crowbar and umbrella, only the model changes depending on the class. To make this more useful I have commented the weaponblock out
// since the precache plugin is most likely to be used on large escape maps where civilians are the only availiable class.
// tl;dr Only @import crowbar.ini if the only class availiable on a map is civilian
