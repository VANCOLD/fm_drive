// Note: If someone goes demo it will crash if they lay a detpack and they haven't got a weapon deployed
// (Occurs if their spawn weapon is blocked and they haven't changed selected another weapon)
// This can be fixed, but its low on my priority list since can only happen if:
// 1) This file is imported on a map where demomen are enabled. (Which shouldn't and won't be done anyway)
// 2) An admin uses the rcon mp_teamplay hack. (which is currently blocked anyway)
